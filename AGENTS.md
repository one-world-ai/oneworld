Please turn the content in pitch.pptx into a static website in index.html.

Currently, I tried to code the first two slides, but only first one displays (and it's a bit wrong).

I want the slides to display in the “scrollytelling” / “slide-to-slide” feel (like Apple product pages): the current slide stays full-screen, and as you start scrolling, it blurs/fades out while the next one fades in.
